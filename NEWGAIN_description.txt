The purpose of the NEWGAIN project is to develop a new injector for the SPIRAL2 LINAC accelerator. It will enable GANIL to provide ion beams of worldwide highest intensities (from proton to uranium), thus opening up unprecedented opportunities for nuclear structure and reaction studies at the extremes of the chart of nuclides from N=Z nuclei at the proton dripline to super-heavy species, including the discovery of new elements, and the production of radioisotopes.
